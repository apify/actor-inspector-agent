The **Agent Actor Inspector** is an Apify AI Actor designed to evaluate and analyze other Apify Actors. It provides detailed reports on code quality, documentation, uniqueness, and pricing competitiveness, helping developers optimize their Actors and users choose the best tools for their needs.

## üåü What is Agent Actor Inspector?

This Actor is built to:

- **Analyze Apify Actors**: Assesses code quality, documentation clarity, uniqueness, and pricing for any specified Actor.
- **Generate Detailed Reports**: Produces structured markdown reports summarizing findings with clear ratings and actionable suggestions.
- **Leverage AI**: Uses OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, or reasoning models like `o3-mini`) for intelligent analysis.
- **Push Results**: Stores the assessment in Apify‚Äôs dataset for easy access and review.

## üéØ Features

- **Code Quality Evaluation**: Checks for tests, linting, security, performance, and style consistency.
- **Documentation Assessment**: Reviews README clarity, input properties, usability, examples, and GitHub visibility.
- **Uniqueness Check**: Compares functionality against similar Actors to determine distinctiveness.
- **Pricing Analysis**: Evaluates competitiveness and transparency of pricing models.
- **Customizable AI Models**: Choose between `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, or `o3-mini` for analysis speed and depth.

## üìà How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide the Actor name (e.g., `apify/instagram-scraper`), select an AI model, and optionally enable debug mode.
2. **Processing**: The Actor fetches Actor details, source code (if available), README, pricing info, and related Actors, then analyzes them using specialized AI agents.
3. **Output**: Generates a markdown report summarizing findings across all categories, pushed to the Apify dataset.

### üí∞ Pricing

This Actor uses the [Pay Per Event](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/docs/next/guides/pay-per-event) (PPE) model for flexible, usage-based pricing. It currently charges a flat fee per task completion.

| Event                  | Price (USD) |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Task Completion        | $1          |

Future updates may include token-based pricing for AI model usage (e.g., per 100 tokens), as hinted in `ppe_utils.py`.

### Input Example

```json
{
  "actorName": "apify/instagram-scraper",
  "modelName": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "debug": false
}
```

### Output Example

A sample report might look like this (stored in the dataset):
