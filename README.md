The **Actor Inspector Agent** is designed to evaluate and analyze other Apify Actors.
It provides detailed reports on code quality, documentation, uniqueness, and pricing competitiveness, helping developers optimize their Actors and users choose the best tools for their needs.

This Agent is built using [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/) and [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python) and is using modern and flexible pricing model for AI Agents [Pay Per Event](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/docs/next/guides/pay-per-event).

   - Includes ratings and suggestions for each category
   - Automatically saves to Apify dataset

### üí∞ Pricing

This Actor uses the [Pay Per Event](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/docs/next/guides/pay-per-event) (PPE) model for flexible, usage-based pricing. It currently charges for Actor start and a flat fee per task completion.

| Event                  | Price (USD) |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Actor start            | $0.05       |
| Task Completion        | $0.95       |

### Input Example

```json
{
  "actorName": "apify/instagram-scraper",
  "modelName": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "debug": false
}
```

### Output Example

## ü§ñ Under the hood with [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/)

This Actor uses CrewAI to orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents that work together to analyze Apify Actors:

### üë• The crew

1. **Code quality specialist**
   ```python
   goal = 'Deliver precise evaluation of code quality, focusing on tests, linting, code smells, security, performance, and style'
   tools = [...]  # Fetches and analyzes source code
   ```

2. **Documentation expert**
   ```python
   goal = 'Evaluate documentation completeness, clarity, and usefulness for potential users'
   tools = [...]  # Analyzes readme and input schema
   ```

3. **Pricing expert**
   ```python
   goal = 'Analyze pricing with respect to other Actors'
   tools = [...]  # Analyzes competition
   ```

#### üîÑ Workflow

1. The main process creates a crew of agents, each with:
   - Specific role and expertise
   - Defined goal and backstory
   - Access to relevant tools
   - Selected LLM model

2. Agents work sequentially to:
   - Gather required information using their tools
   - Analyze data within their domain
   - Provide structured evaluations
   - Pass insights to other agents when needed

3. Results are combined into a comprehensive markdown report with:
   - Detailed analysis per category
   - Clear ratings (great/good/bad)
   - Actionable improvement suggestions

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tools

Each agent has access to specialized tools that:
- Fetch actor source code and analyze its structure
- Retrieve documentation and readme content
- Get pricing information and find similar actors
- Process and structure the gathered data

The CrewAI framework ensures collaboration between agents while maintaining focus on their specific areas of expertise.
